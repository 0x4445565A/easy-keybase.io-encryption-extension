# Easy KeyBase.io Encrypt Extension
A Google Chrome extension that uses public keys from [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) to encrypt messages.

Easy KeyBase.io is transparent and done completely in javascript.
While some do not like this (encrypting with JS) it's the only real option for a chrome extension.

### Features ###
- Encrypting messages with public keys from [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/)
- Auto complete Keybase.io searching
- Immediately copy encrypted text to clipboard
- Export straight to [pastebin](https://pastebin.com]
- Highlighted text can be right clicked and encrypted

(or just use [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy), but that's less fun)...

### NOTE ###
The Pastebin support does work, but PGP encrypted messages can sometimes get pegged as spam.
You can still view them through the link; you just have to pass the captcha first when viewing the link.
